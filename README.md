Project completed in the Spring 2020 semester for MTC 223 (Music Theory: 20th Century) with Dr. Knowles

Additive synthesis is the process of synthesizing complex sounds by adding sine waves together. This webpage demonstrates instrumental additive synthesis using the Web Audio API provided in JavaScript. For this project, I analyzed the timbre of various instruments using [SPEAR](http://www.klingbeil.com/spear/) and [Audition](https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html) by deconstructing sound samples from the [Musical Instrument Samples Database](http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MIS.html) (made available by the University of Iowa Electronic Music Studios). Then, I reconstructed these sounds by adding sine waves together, generating each sine wave using the oscillators provided by the Web Audio API.
